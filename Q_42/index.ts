//Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

let magiciansArray :string[] = ["magician_1", "magician_2", "magician_3", "magician_4"]


function make_great(arr:string[]) {
  
  for (let index = 0; index < arr.length; index++) {
   
    magiciansArray[index] = "The Great" + arr[index]
  }
}
make_great(magiciansArray)
console.log(magiciansArray);
